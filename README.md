# equi_match_test
Test repo for openCV equirectangular match

In this repository I have run some tests to see whether matching results with two equirectangulars works as expected.

It turns out, that, with a lamp-post quite high up in the image, which is subject to heavier distortion than the middle (horizon), matching becomes unreliable.

An additional test should be run to see what happens with a facade.
